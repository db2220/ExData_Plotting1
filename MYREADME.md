# Exploratory Data Course Project Supplemental Read Me 

Instructions on how to create the four graphs for the Exploratory Data Course Project

1. Manually download and unzip the data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip

2. Change to the directory where the data file is extracted

3. Pull the following files from the github repository:
  * a. prepData.R - reads the data file in and creates the subset of the data needed
  * b. plot1.R - creates the histogram with the frequency of Global Active Power in a bitmapped file
  * c. plot2.R - creates the plot of Global Active Power over the two day period set in a bitmapped file
  * d. plot3.R - creates the plot of all three Sub_metering values in a bitmapped file
  * e. plot4.R - creates four plots in one bitmapped file
  
4. Source all five files

5. Run the plot scripts individually by passing in the data file name

6. The bitmapped files will be created in the same directory as the data file.
